# RoboArena

Another Robot-themed SDL2 program. Currently does nothing but build cross-platform and display a blank window.

# TODO

Almost Everything.

# Build

## MingGW32 / MingGW64

In the project folder create a build folder. Open in a MingGW command prompt and type:

    cmake -DSDL2_DIR=C:/SDL2-2.0.8 -G "CodeBlocks" ..

Where SDL2_DIR is pointing to the SDL2 MingGW libraries.
